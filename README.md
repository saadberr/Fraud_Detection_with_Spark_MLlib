# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning library Spark MLlib

Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property
from being obtained through false pretenses. Thus, Financial fraud detection is
a challenge that must be taken seriously. Although fraudulent transactions are
rare and represent only a very small fraction of the activity within an
organization. It still can quickly turn into significant financial losses and
negative reputational effects on the organization.

The primary objective of this work is to develop an application for detecting
fraudulent transactions using the Apache Spark MLlib library.
